*****New Processes*****

The new processes added to Project 4 are:
- characterCounter.js
- dijkstra.js

This process simulates a multithreaded environment. Multiple threads read from the same file and update a single shared array of character counts. The process uses Mutex locks to avoid a race condition.

To run and test a process, type it's name. For example: characterCounter.js [Enter]
